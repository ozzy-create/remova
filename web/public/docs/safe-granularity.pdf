Safe Granularity in Trade Data Protection
==========================================

Introduction
------------
This guide explains how to balance data privacy with business utility when implementing trade data protection measures.

Key Principles
--------------
1. Suppress identifiers while preserving aggregate insights
2. Maintain lane-level visibility without exposing specific relationships
3. Protect pricing strategies while allowing market analysis
4. Enable compliance monitoring without revealing competitive information

Safe Granularity Levels
------------------------

SAFE TO PUBLISH:
- Port-to-port traffic volumes (aggregated)
- HS code summaries by region
- Seasonal shipping patterns (anonymized)
- General market trends and analysis

PROCEED WITH CAUTION:
- Specific shipping lanes with volumes
- Product categories with frequency data
- Regional supplier distributions
- Time-series data with identifiers removed

PROTECT/SUPPRESS:
- Company names and identifiers
- Specific supplier relationships
- Exact shipping dates and quantities
- Pricing and financial information
- Detailed product specifications
- Contact information and addresses

Implementation Strategy
-----------------------
1. Assess current data exposure across platforms
2. Classify information by sensitivity level
3. Implement graduated suppression approach
4. Monitor for re-identification risks
5. Adjust granularity based on business needs

Best Practices
--------------
- Start with broader suppression, narrow carefully
- Consider indirect identification vectors
- Balance utility with protection needs
- Document decision rationale
- Review granularity decisions periodically

This document provides general guidance. Specific implementations should consider individual business requirements and regulatory obligations.
