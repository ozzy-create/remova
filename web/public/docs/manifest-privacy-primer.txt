Manifest privacy primer (19 CFR 103.31)

What this covers
- What vessel manifest data is and why it appears on commercial platforms
- Eligibility and scope of privacy requests (importers, exporters, consignees)
- Filing basics: who files, where to file, what to include, and common name variants
- Timelines: effective dates, coverage windows, renewals every two years
- Maintaining privacy: handling name changes, DBAs, subsidiaries
- Known platform behaviors and expected lag

Checklist
- Primary entity name and all known variants (DBA, legal, abbreviations)
- EIN/DUNS (if applicable)
- Contact for notices
- Tracking/renewal calendar (60/30/7 reminders)

Notes
- Privacy is not retroactive. Expect a short lag before platforms stop showing new data.
- Preserve business utility by keeping safe summaries (lanes/ports/HS) where needed.
